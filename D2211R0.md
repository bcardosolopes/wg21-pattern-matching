# Abstract

With the introduction of Pattern Matching into C++, there's an opportunity to
give it support for "exhaustiveness checking" which enables compile-time
detection and diagnosis of several common Pattern Matching bugs. This paper
describes the design for such a feature that intentionally caters to typical
software engineering patterns and commonly understood semantics, as opposed to
a pedantic interpretation of code. It is our hope that such a design will
maximize this feature's utility as a bug prevention mechanism.

```C++
enum Color { Red, Green, Blue };
//...
Color c = /*...*/;
vec3 v = inspect(c) {                 // ERROR: Missing case 'Blue'
  case Red   => vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  case Green => vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
};

vec3 v2 = inspect(c) {                // OKAY
  case Red   => vec3(1.0, 0.0, 0.0);
  case Green => vec3(0.0, 1.0, 0.0);
  case Blue  => vec3(0.0, 0.0, 1.0);
};
```

# Examples

# Specification

# Suppress arm contribution to exhaustiveness checking

# Analysis of alternatives

* Mention that this is something other languages use.

## Use warnings instead of errors

## Require pedantically exhaustive `enum` inspection

# Conclusion
